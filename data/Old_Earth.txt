Old Earth
SPOILER ALERT!  While this entire Wiki contains spoilers, this particular article contains MAJOR SPOILERS for all books.


Old Earth was humanity's ancestral homeworld, which was slowly destroyed over the course of a century by the Big Mistake, being "eaten" from the inside out by a black hole said to have been accidentally created by a scientific team in Kiev.
History
The alleged destruction was said to have been deliberately planned by the TechnoCore and its Hegemony allies for the enslavement of mankind. However, it is revealed that Old Earth is still intact as the Joseph Severn cybrid it sent there by unkown forces.
Later, in the Endymion books, it is revealed that Old Earth was actually spirited away to the Lesser Magellanic Cloud 160,000 light years from Pacem , by the creatures of the Void Which Binds to protect it from the TechnoCore and to allow experimentation of mankind by the "Lions and Tigers and Bears" to determine whether mankind was ready to access the Void. Old Earth was returned to its original location in orbit around Sol at the exact moment of the Aenean Shared Moment.
