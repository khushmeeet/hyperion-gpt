Treeship
Treeships are unique spacecraft created and used by the Templars, measuring at least one kilometer in lenghth. They consist of a single, massive living tree harvested from the island of Hokkaido on God's Grove, which is then made spaceworthy through heavy use of containment fields generated by ergs. They were the pride of the Templars, and the cost to create one was immense.
Treeships are typically captained by a single Templar with the honorific of True Voice of the Tree and crewed by a complement of clones.
