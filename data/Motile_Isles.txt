Motile Isles
The oceans of the planet Maui-Covenant are dotted with livingÂ motile isles, which the human inhabitants of the world live upon. The isles are propelled by sail-like leaves and rudder-like vines, allowing them to navigate during their annual migration to the equator. It is unknown whether they are single organisms or assemblages of symbiotic organisms.
