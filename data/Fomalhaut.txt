Fomalhaut
Fomalhaut was an small Outback world that was rich in minerals and home to only a few thousand colonists during the Web Era. General Horace Glennon-Height battled the Hegemony of Man for control of this world at the beginning of his rebellion and won over the world, in what became known as the Battle of Fomalhaut. The planet was twenty-three months time debt away from the Web.[1]
