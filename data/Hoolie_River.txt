Hoolie River
The Hoolie River is a river on the planet Hyperion running north-northeast from the city of Keats in the south to the southern shore of the Sea of Grass at Edge in the north. The Hoolie River was often used as a convenient route of travel for pilgrims on their way to the Time Tombs north of the Bridle Range, including the pilgrims on the Final Shrike Pilgrimage. Many locations along the river were destroyed by Hyperion's Self-Defense Force while trying to contain the Shrike following the opening of the Time Tombs.
