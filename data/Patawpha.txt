Patawpha
Patawpha is a planet that was part of the WorldWeb. It is covered in endless swamps. It had abundant and constant rainfall, and known to have monsoons that would span many months, such as the Hundred Day Monsoon. People lived in the river delta areas, and children would visit the extensive fens hunting for toad flyers, bendits, and Spanish moss serpents.
Senate CEO Meina Gladstone was from Patawpha. Gladstone, and the people in Patawpha's river-delta regions, were said to have a peculiar accent akin to pre-Hegira English, with precise syntax.

Pax Era
Aenea lived in Patawpha for three months, building mansions in the interwoven branches and trunks growing from the enormous swamps.
