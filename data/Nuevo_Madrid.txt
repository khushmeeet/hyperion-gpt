Nuevo Madrid
Nuevo Madrid is the planet that the ancestors of the Mariaists left for MadreDeDios when Nuevo Madrid had voted to join in the Pax and have its Christian churches submit to the Vatican. [1]
Father Capitan Federico de Soya's family originated from there, and there returned after MadreDeDios lost its population. De Soya's sister Melinda serves as a priest in Nuevo Madrid.[1]
