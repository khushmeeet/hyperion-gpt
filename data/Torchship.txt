Torchship
A torchship is a class of spacecraft powered by a fusion drive. Its name is taken from the fusion flame generated by its propulsion system – which can extend scores of kilometers[1] – making the entire vessel resemble a lit torch.
Torchships come in a variety of designs, but commonly contain a small command and weapons module dwarfed by the Hawking drive and in-system fusion thrust sphere.[2]
