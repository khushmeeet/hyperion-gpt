Pilgrims' Rest
Pilgrim's Rest is a small port town at the foot of the Bridle Range, along the northeastern shore of the Sea of Grass. It is the southern terminus of the tramway across the Bridle Range to Chronos Keep and the Time Tombs beyond.[1] Even prior to abandonment following the opening of the Time Tombs, Pilgrims's Rest contained little more than hovels and cheap hotels.[1]
