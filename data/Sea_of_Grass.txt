Sea of Grass
The Sea of Grass is a large plain covered in several billion acres of grass on the planet Hyperion. The grass is uniform in height, over the heads of an average human. The grass is too sharp to allow transit across the sea on foot, and contains grass serpents that present further danger to any would-be traveler. As a result, the sea is typically crossed by windwagon.[1]

Ports
