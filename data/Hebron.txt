Hebron
Hebron is a planet that is part of the WorldWeb of the Hegemony of Man. Its name is derived from a city in Earth's Holy Land, and it is occupied primarily by Jews. It is a harsh desert world with two moons. It was once home to a sentient extraterrestrial species, the Seneschai Aluit, but they are believed to be extinct as of the time of the planet's colonization. 
Its capital during the Web Era is New Jerusalem, where the planet's only farcaster terminex is located.
Sol Weintraub moved to Hebron to escape the media circus surrounding his daughter's backward aging.
