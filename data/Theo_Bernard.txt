Theo Bernard
Theo Bernard is the "great-great-great-etcetera-granddaughter" of Theo Lane. She is a large and solid middle-aged woman, tall with strong features and amazing violet eyes. She is deeply tanned and very fit. She enjoys laughing.
She looks to be in her 40s or early 50s when Raul meets her for the first time.
Theo was a Pax colonist on Maui-Covenant until she met and befriended Aenea. At that time, she escaped the Pax and joined the local Sirist rebels because of something Aenea told Theo Lane almost three hundred years ago. It had been passed down all many generations. Theo Bernard knew that Aenea would be on Maui-Covenant.
After the events on Maui-Covenant, Theo accompanied Aenea on her following destinations.
She was carrying a Cruciform until it was removed.
