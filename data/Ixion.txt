Ixion
Ixion was considered a powerful planet when it was part of the WorldWeb. It was a high-gravity world with at least one jungle plateau.
After The Fall, Ixion had never recovered properly. Its population included warring tribes of neo-Marxists and Native American resurgencists, as well as bands of renegade and roving ARNists who were attempting to bring back all of Old Earth's species of dinosaur.
After her period on Old Earth, Aenea's first "farcast" visit was to Ixion, where she worked as an architect in leading the reconstruction efforts in the old cities of Canbar, Iiiumut, and Maoville.
During the Pax Era, Its entire population was rendered "lifeless" and sequestered elsewhere by elements of the TechnoCore.
