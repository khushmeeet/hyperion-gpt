River manta
River mantas are a species of aquatic creature native to the rivers of Hyperion, such as Hoolie River. They are large and powerful creatures that are used to pull river barges such as the Benares. The mantas were used for a period of time before being released and fresh ones harnessed. They were kept in holding pens. River mantas or similar creatures may also live in the sea on Hyperion.
They were edible, in particular Kans River mantas.
