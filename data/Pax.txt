Pax
The Pax was the primary governing body of the human interstellar diaspora following the fall of the Hegemony of Man at the end of the 29th century AD. The Pax was brought into power by the rise of the Roman Catholic Church following the Church's discovery of methods for successful and repeatable resurrection by cruciform, spread throughout humanity as the Sacrament of Holy Resurrection during the reign of Pope Julius VI.

Rise & Expansion
The church rose to power after Lenar Hoyt made a secret alliance with the AI TechnoCore to perfect the Cruciform resurrection. Once large enough, the church established a strong military presence on Pacem, which eventually spread to other planets as more people began accepting the Cruciform and its promise of immortality.
