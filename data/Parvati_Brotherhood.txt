Parvati Brotherhood
The Parvati Brotherhood is an organization of mercenaries based outside of the WorldWeb. Their members are identified by a tattoo of a blue trident on the left side of the chest, above the heart.
Five Goondas from the Parvati Brotherhood were sent to Old Earth by the bishop of the Shrike Church of Lusus to capture Johnny and bring him to the temple until they were neutralized by Brawne Lamia, Johnny's bodyguard.
