Windsor-in-Exile
The Kingdom of Windsor-in-Exile is the official name of the government of the planet Hyperion. It is ruled by His Royal Highness King William XXIII, colloquially known as Sad King Billy.
The Kingdom was located on the Outback world of Asquith at the time of the Glennon-Height Rebellion. Fearing the rebellion would soon make its way to Asquith, Sad King Billy relocated the Kingdom to the planet Hyperion at staggering expense.
