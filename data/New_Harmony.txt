New Harmony
New Harmony was a moon of the planet Renaissance Minor. It was terraformed and inhabited. [1] During the Pax period, New Harmony was host to Pax-controlled orbital lunar garrisons. Despite the presence of such lunar garrisons, the Pax only had a foothold on the world, and it was a non-Christian world. [2]
Its entire population was subject to being "rendered lifeless" and transported elsewhere in a joint action by the Pax and the TechnoCore, along with the inhabitants of several other worlds. [1]
