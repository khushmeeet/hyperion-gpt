Lusus
Lusus is a planet within the WorldWeb. It is notable for having one of the highest gravitational fields of any colonized planet in the Web.
Lusians live in huge blocks of residential and industrial buildings, known as "hives". One of the most dangerous was Dreg's Hive , where the local underground was organized. Lusians were used to the tight living areas, so claustrophobia was rare, but most of them suffered from agoraphobia upon traveling to less-crowded areas.
