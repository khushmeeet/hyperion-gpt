Zygoat
Zygoats are domesticated pack animals used on the planet T'ien Shan. Presumably they are a hybrid of type sheep or goat, adapted to the sharp ridges and tall peaks of T'ien Shan. Occasionally, bells may be hung around their necks. Their fleece was used for clothing and it was waterproof. They produced milk that was used to make butter and zygoat cheese. They were also eaten as food.
