Nordhold was an important planet of the Worldweb.  Nordholm is a world of long coasts and cold seas, originally devoted to fishing.  In Martin Silenus’ multi-world house, the library looked out to the glaciers and green skies of Nordholm. 
In the moments leading up to the perceived Ouster attack upon the Hegemony, Nordhold suffered terrorist attacks from Glennon-Height loyalists, who had been quiet for three-quarters of a century. Ater the Fall, the people left the cities back to the coasts and their ancestral fishing boats.
