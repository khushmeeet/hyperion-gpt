Glennon-Height Rebellion
The Glennon-Height Rebellion was a large-scale rebellion against the Hegemony of Man led by General Horace Glennon-Height. It began in 2510 with the Battle of Fomalhaut and concluded after the Hegemony won the Coal Sack Battle and executed Glennon-Height in 2519.
The rebellion resurged in the Class Three colonies in 2716, led by Glennon-Height's cloned grandson, who was killed on Renaissance Vector in 2717.
