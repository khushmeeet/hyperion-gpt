Description
Grass is a planet that was part of the WorldWeb and accessible via farcaster during the Web Era.  It is covered in yellow grasslands known as the World Prairie.
Grass had at least two suns. When the poet Martin Silenus lost his muse, one of the planets he visited for inspiration was Grass, where he would watch the suns set on the windblown prairies of Grass.  

Pax Era
Aenea dropped off one of her followers on Grass to prepare the population for the Shared Moment.
