Upon leaving Mare Infinitus, Father Captain de Soya decides to change his search pattern, heading for Hebron instead of the original planned destination, Svoboda.[7] Upon entering orbit of Hebron, however, the Raphael encounters some resistance and flees the system, returning to Mare Infinitus instead of proceeding to Svoboda for an unknown reason.[8]
