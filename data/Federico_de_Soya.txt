Upon leaving Mare Infinitus, Father Captain de Soya decides to change his search pattern, heading for Hebron instead of the original planned destination, Svoboda. Upon entering orbit of Hebron, however, the Raphael encounters some resistance and flees the system, returning to Mare Infinitus instead of proceeding to Svoboda for an unknown reason.
