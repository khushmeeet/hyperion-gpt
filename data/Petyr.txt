Petyr
SPOILER ALERT!  While this entire Wiki contains spoilers, this particular article contains MAJOR SPOILERS for all books.


Petyr is the son of the Aenea and Raul Endymion. He makes a brief appearance at the end of the novella Orphans of the Helix alongside the Shrike and Dem Loa, in which he redirects the course of the Helix starship that is taking the people of the Amoiete Spectrum Helix to their new, yet-to-be-found world.
Petyr appears to have greatly developed the powers that arise out of contact with The Void Which Binds. For instance, he is able to resolve "internal inconsistencies" in the now autonomous AI entities by embracing them.
