Timeline
This page is a Timeline of the events that occur before, during and after the opening of the Time Tombs on the planet Hyperion. Most dates are listed in the Common Era, known in the time of the Hegemony as the "old calendar" or "old reckoning"[1]. Dates in the Common Era numbering system use the following designations:

BCE - Before the Common Era
CE - Common Era
A new calendar was adopted following the establishment of the Hegemony of Man. Dates in the Hegemony Standard calendar are provided, when known:

PC - Present Calendar - used for dates after the founding of the Hegemony of Man[2]
After the fall of the Hegemony, dates were typically calculated in terms of "years after the fall"

AF - Years After the Fall - used for dates after the fall of the Hegemony of Man
Additionally, individual planets almost always have a local calendar, typically based on the local solar year. A relevant local calendar is that used on the planet Hyperion:

ADC - After Dropship Crash - a designation used for local dates on the planet Hyperion.
Note: It is assumed in all the calculations below that a "standard" year is an Old Earth year, consisting of [[2]] days. Dates in local calendars will obviously use a different year length, which may add uncertainty to calculations involving local dates or based on statements where the length/type of year is unspecified.

Circa 500 BCE
Democracy begins in the Greek city-states ofOld Earth.[3]
Circa 33 CE
Jesus of Nazareth was the first Human to understand the Void that Binds. While alone in the wilderness, he travelled to the future - the time following his crucifiction - and worked his miracles on Earth. This is why he was believed to have risen from the dead. This is explained by Aenea in The Rise of Endymion
2038 CE
"Nuclear Jihad" wipes out the shortly-lived nation of Palestine on Old Earth.[4]
2143 CE = 0 PC
Year zero in the Hegemony Standard Calendar.[5] Presumably, the date of the founding of the Hegemony.
2200s CE
2238 - The Big Mistake - a team in Kiev creates a black hole that begins to devour Old Earth from the inside out for the next 100 years.[6] This year is 526 years prior to the Final Shrike Pilgrimage and 95 years after the founding of the Hegemony.
Some time later - The Ousters leave Old Earth System 450 years prior to their encounter with the Consul[7]; this is after the Big Mistake, since they have data regarding the origin of the Big Mistake at the time. It is also prior to Martin Silenus's birth, since he references the Ouster migration in his early childhood.[8]
2282 - The Hegira begins. Humanity leaves Old Earth for the stars.[9] This year is 44 years after the Big Mistake.
2300s CE
2306 - Dropship crash on Hyperion.
2318 - Martin Silenus is born on Old Earth.[10]
2338 - The Death of Old Earth. Martin Silenus departs Old Earth for Heaven's Gate.[10]
In this intervening period while Martin "slept", the Hegemony was formalized and the WorldWeb spun into something close to its final shape. The All Thing took its place, the TechnoCore seceded, and the Ousters retreated to darkness. All had been in progress prior to Martin's departure for Heaven's Gate. [11]
2400s CE
A. Bettik is bio-manufactured in the twenty-fifth century AD, in the year 26 ADC on the local Hyperion calendar.[12]
2500s CE

The Glennon-Height Rebellion occurs while Martin is on Asquith.
2520 - Martin and Sad King Billy depart for Hyperion.[17]
2524 - Sad King Billy's colonists arrive at Hyperion.[6]
2533 - First appearance of the Shrike.[18] Martin retitles his epic poem The Hyperion Cantos.[19] Billy orders the evacuation of the City of Poets.[20]
2554 - King Billy Dies on Hyperion.[21]

January 3: Paul and Tuk reach the flame forest, and see their first tesla tree in late afternoon and change into flame-forest gear.
January 4: The trees nearly kill Tuk and Paul - they survive due to lack of undergrowth, as well as Tuk’s skill in placing their tent away from other targets.
January 6: Tuk and Paul emerge from the flame forest, reaching the Cleft.
January 7: Paul enjoys his exile now he has reached the Cleft.
January 8: Tuk is murdered in his sleep by the Bikura for not being of the Cruciform. January 14: Paul uses the machete to cut small trees for a lean-to. He begins foraging, and visits Tuk’s grave.
January 15: The Bikura find Paul, mistaking him to be of the Cruciform due to his cross. He goes to their village.
January 22: Paul takes photographs and reads videos and videoclips of the village, puzzled at many things that will later become clear to him when it is too late.
January 23: Paul continues to learn more about the Bikaru.
January 24: At 7:30, Paul lowers himself down the cliff edge while the Bikaru are foraging. He discovers a path to a temple carved into the south wall of the Cleft, where a multi-jeweled cross is present.
January 26: Paul violates the Bikaru nudity taboo by allowing Del to see him naked waist-up. Unfortunately, this also allows them to see he is not of the Cruciform. He is nearly murdered, but it is decided they will make him of the Cruciform.
January 29: The Bikaru burn Paul’s clothes and everything he has stored information about them on.
January 31: The Bikaru bring Paul through the temple, which he has named the “baliscia”, to a cave where the Shrike examines Paul, and leaves.

When he wakes up, the Crufirom has grown into his body, and cannot be removed.

February 28: Paul attempts to cut the Cruciform out with a sharpeneed stone and fails.
March 18: Alpha begins to speak again.
April 2: Will is discovered to have died. As only a skeleton is left, the Cruciform cannot regenerate him normally.

July 19: Paul has been on Hyperion for one local year.
August 19: While Paul is working on quarrying stones on the ledges below the shelf where the chapel is going up, he discovers the arrestor rods, which he could use to penetrate the flame forests if the Cruciform didn’t prevent it. His crude experiments with the medscanner continue. He sits on the ledge below the half-finished cha[e; and considers possibilities about driving the Cruciform out.
September 15: Paul finishes the chapel. He crucifies himself in a tesla tree to rid himself of the Cruciform and is electrocuted and resurrected for 7 years.

↑ 1.0 1.1 Hyperion, 1995. 264 - Melio uses the term "old reckoning" in his recording to Rachel after she contracts Merlin's sickness. The term "old calendar" is used elsewhere in Hyperion. Need a reference.

↑ Hyperion, 1995. 31 - The PC designation was used by Father Paul Dure when computing the date of the beginning of his exile. The assumption that PC stands for Present Calendar is conjecture.

↑ Date from [[1]] - This event is included in this list as a basis for the comment by Martin Silenus that democracies had been around for approximately three thousand years prior to the Hegira.

↑ Assuming the Hegemony Standard calendar starts at the founding of the Hegemony of Man, year zero is 589 years prior to 2732 CE. (Hyperion, 1995. 31.) We do know that the Hegemony was founded "decades" prior to the Big Mistake, since the Consul states the Big Mistake had been planned by the Technocore and "the fledgling government of the Hegemony". (Hyperion, 1995. 468.) 

↑ 6.0 6.1 The Big Mistake occurs in a year ending in '38 (Hyperion, 1995. 468). The year is 2238 based on the following calculation: Old Earth dies 100 years later (Hyperion, 1995. 183). Martin arrives at Heaven's Gate 167 years after that (Hyperion, 1995. 187). He remains on Heaven's Gate for 4 years (1500 days - Hyperion, 1995. 189) then spends 3 years writing Dying Earth II and 6 more writing up to Dying Earth IX (Hyperion, 1995. 206).  Martin moves to Asquith and knows King Billy for "several" (assume 2) years prior to departing for Hyperion (Hyperion, 1995. 213). Arrival to Hyperion is four years later - one year between Asquith and the Web (Hyperion, 1995. 212) and three more to Hyperion (Hyperion, 1995. 4). This puts the date of arrival to Hyperion at 2338+100+167+4+3+6+2+4=2524, which is 240 years prior to the Final Shrike Pilgrimage in 2764. We know that Sad King Billy's colonization of Hyperion occurs between 200 (Hyperion, 1995. 179) and 250 (Hyperion, 1995. 233) years prior to 2764. Q.E.D.

↑ Melio states that 2739 CE is 457 years after the Hegira (Hyperion, 1995. 264.) Martin states that the Old Earth families began to sponsor migrations "After three thousand years of dabbling with democracy." (Hyperion, 1995. 182.) 2282 is 2782 years after the first democracies circa 500 BCE. Q.E.D.

↑ The year of the Fall is computed from Raul's statement that he was born in the year 3099 AD, which was 247 years After the Fall - Endymion, 1995, 5. It is consistent with Father Dure's statement that the year 3131 is 279 years After the Fall - The Rise of Endymion, 1997, 19.
