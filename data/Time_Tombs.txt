Time Tombs
The Time Tombs are a group of six mysterious structures in a remote valley on the planet Hyperion. Prior to the fall of the Hegemony of Man it was widely believed that the Time Tombs were constructed in the far future and subsequently sent traveling backward in time. Speculation regarding the purpose of the tombs and the reason they were sent traveling backward in time raged until these questions were answered definitively during the Final Shrike Pilgrimage.Â 
The six tombs are:

Sphinx;
Jade Tomb;
Crystal Monolith;
Obelisk;
Shrike Palace; and
Cave Tombs.
