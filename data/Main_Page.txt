WELCOME TO HYPERION CANTOS WIKI


This wiki is devoted to the award-winning Hyperion series of science fiction novels by author Dan Simmons. The story is centered around the events set into motion by the opening of the Time Tombs on the planet Hyperion. The story is divided into four separate novels - Hyperion, The Fall of Hyperion, Endymion, and The Rise of Endymion - sometimes considered two larger stories each split into two parts for publication convenience. The short story Orphans of the Helix is also set in the Hyperion universe. The group of stories set in the Hyperion universe as a whole is sometimes referred to as the Hyperion Cantos, not to be confused with the Hyperion Cantos that form a major plot device within the stories themselves. This wiki allows fans of these stories to collaboratively create an extensive and comprehensive database of information related to the Hyperion universe.

WORLDS OF THE HYPERION CANTOS


The stories of the Hyperion Cantos take place in a rich variety of worlds. The characters of the novels take the readers on incredible journeys to the many places conquered by humanity in the distant future. Most of them are planets, but the Worlds of the Hyperion Cantos also include moons, orbital colonies, terraformed asteroids, and some fantastically engineered places such as the Startree Biosphere and other Ouster/Templar feats of bioastroengineering.
