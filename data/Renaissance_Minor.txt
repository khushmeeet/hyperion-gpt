Renaissance Minor
Renaissance Minor, also known as Renaissance M., is an agricultural world, and the second planet orbiting the Renaissance System sun (the third planet being Renaissance Vector). After the Fall of the farcasters, both worlds were said to benefit from an arrangement in which Renaissance V. manufactured goods and Renaissance M. provided food. It had at least one moon. It had a terraformed moon called New Harmony. 
During the Pax period, Renaissance M. had Pax-controlled orbital and lunar garrisons.
