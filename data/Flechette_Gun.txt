Flechette Gun
A Flechette gun is a weapon that fires projectiles with a sharp tip, and a vaned tail for stable flight. In the Hyperion Cantos the ammunition of such a weapon has developed to the point where flechette rounds would each burst thousands of these small projectiles towards the target with an unmistakable whining sound. The effect of a successful firing was that the target was torn to pieces.
