Heaven's Gate
Heaven's Gate is a planet orbiting the star Vega Prime [1] and part of the WorldWeb during the Web Era. Originally it was a miserable world of boiling mud, pestilent swamps, and unbreathable atmosphere. It was bombarded with blazing radiation from its sun Vega Prime. [1]
However, the Hegemony of Man had terraformed it to shade trees and comfort. Its Promenade gardens were a famous attraction of the capital Mudflat City. Its terraforming depended on an orbital containment sphere and atmosphere-generating stations that took centuries to be built. [1]
During its prime, it had a population of 400 million people. [1]
During the Pax Era, its population was reduced to less than a dozen mineral prospectors and an orbital Pax garrison that rarely ventured into the ruined world. [1]
