Tesla tree
Tesla trees are a plant-like lifeform native to Hyperion. They are notable for their unusual shape, having a tall trunk terminating in an onion-shaped bulb capped with leafy branches. During certain weather conditions, the trees accumulate massive amounts of electric charge in their bulbs, which they then discharge as bolts of electrical energy. These bolts often lead to wildfires of titanic proportions.


The trees derive their name from the ancient Old Earth inventor Nikola Tesla, more precisely from the electromagnetic field generator he invented (now known as the Tesla coil).
