Father Gawronski
Father Gawronski is one of the two Legionaries of Christ who traveled by Archangel Starship to the torchship Balthasar with a priority omega message for Father Captain Federico de Soya to return to Pacem immediately. The voyage was immediately fatal, however Father Gawronski was unable to be successfully resurrected within the risky three hour resurrection procedure through the function of the Cruciform and an extended stay in the resurrection creche was required for his reintegration. Father Vandrisse, Gawronski's travelling companion, was more fortunate and was able to deliver the message as intended.[1]
