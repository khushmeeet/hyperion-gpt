Sibiatu's Bitterness
Sibiatu's Bitterness, also known as Inevitable Grace during the Pax era, is a planet in the Lacaille 9352 star system, at a distance of 10.7 light years from Old Earth System.
Prior to the Fall, Sibiatu's Bitterness was part of the WorldWeb. A section of the River Tethys passed through the world, flowing through a perspex tunnel holding a temperate oxygen-nitrogen atmosphere, due to the planet's sulfurous environment and toxic "methane winds".
