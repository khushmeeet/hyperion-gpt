Stick People
The Stick People were a species of sentient beings native to the world of Durulis. The Hyperion Cantos do not provide further information on these beings, or whether they still existed at the time of the Final Shrike Pilgrimage. Presumably only evidential traces of the Stick People had been found by humanity by that time.
