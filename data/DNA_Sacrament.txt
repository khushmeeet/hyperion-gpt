DNA Sacrament
SPOILER ALERT!  While this entire Wiki contains spoilers, this particular article contains MAJOR SPOILERS for all books.


Introduction
The DNA Sacrament was the sharing of Aenea's DNA-modifying virus that was given to her by her father, the second John Keats cybrid, Johnny. It began as Aenea started sharing tiny amounts of her blood among her followers on worlds such as T'ien Shan, and was later spread by her followers to billions of humans on hundreds of worlds, creating a new social, religious and political group known as the Aeneans. The sacrament was normally given out mixed in with wine.

Effects
Those who shared of the sacrament began developing new abilities to access The Void Which Binds within days, including the ability to access the infinite amount of memories that inhabit it, and to "hear the song of the stars" - which means being able to freecast.
