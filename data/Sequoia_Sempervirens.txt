SPOILER ALERT! The section(s) below are MAJOR SPOILERS.
During the Pax Era, the Sequoia was captained by True Voice of the Startree Ket Rosteen. Shortly after Aenea's death, the treeship and its many ergs were used to ferry Martin Silenus' entire building complex on Hyperion to bring him, as well as Raul Endymion and many of Aenea's friends to Old Earth.
