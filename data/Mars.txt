Mars
Mars is the fourth planet of the Sol system. It was the first extraterrestrial planet to be colonized by humankind, and after the Big Mistake it became a preferred target of pilgrims. Mars itself had no public farcasters.

Mars housed the FORCE military academy, the Olympus Command School, on the biggest mountain of the planet, Olympos Mons.
