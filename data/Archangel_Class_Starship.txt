Archangel Class Starship
Archangel Class Starships are Pax interstellar spacecraft equipped with Gideon Drive technology that allows them to travel instantaneously between any two points in space. Due to the excessive gravities involved, human occupants cannot survive archangel voyages, and therefore archangel class ships are most commonly employed as uncrewed couriers. However, crewed travel is possible through the use of fugue tanks to contain the remains of born-again Christians until such time as they can be resurrected under medical supervision, or automatic resurrection creches for resurrection beyond the range of medical care.
The Gideon Drive essentially works as an ad-hoc farcaster portal creator, ripping through The Void Which Binds.
