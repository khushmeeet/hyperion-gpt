Lee Three
Lee Three is a planet of the Outback. The Hegemony had battled the Ousters for control of this planet. It was under the auspices of the Colonial Service. [1]
In the moments leading up to the perceived Ouster attack upon the Hegemony, Lee Three suffered terrorist attacks from Glennon-Height loyalists, who had been quiet for three-quarters of a century. [2]
Rhadamanth Nemes, when speaking with Pax officials, claimed that most of her military training was done on Lee Three and on the Lambert Ring territories. [3]
