Father Vandrisse
Father Vandrisse is one of the two priests who traveled by Archangel Starship to the torchship Balthasar with a priority omega message for Father Captain Federico de Soya to return to Pacem immediately. The voyage was immediately fatal, however Father Vandrisse was able to be successfully resurrected within three hours through the function of the Cruciform. Father Gawronski, Vandrisse's travelling companion, was not so fortunate, and an extended stay in the resurrection creche was required for his reintegration.
