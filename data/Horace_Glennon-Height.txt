Horace Glennon-Height
General Horace Glennon-Height was a former member of FORCE who started an interplanetary rebellion against the Hegemony of Man in 2510 with the Battle of Fomalhaut. In leading this rebellion, he became a mass murderer. He owned a private C-plus starship, which was stolen from the governor of Sol Draconi Septem. He was executed after the Hegemony won the Coal Sack Battle in 2519 and put an end to the rebellion.
Long after, in 2762, FORCE recreated the personality of General Glennon-Height to see what made him such a brilliant general.
