Flame Forest
The Flame Forests of Hyperion are incredible biome of plants that evolved to generate and/or survive great discharges of electricity and fire. They are dominated by the Tesla trees. These trees are capable of storing static charge and igniting everything flammable within range when they discharge. Many native flora have adapted to cope with or even take advantage of the frequent forest fires, such as the bifurcated bestos plants (that looked like "the rotten cocks of dead buried giants"), prometheus trees, phoenix shrubs, firewhip, and amber lambents.
