↑ Endymion, 1995, 308. We know NGC 2629 was formerly known as Wolf 359 due to Raul's narrative of Father Captain de Soya's search for Aenea in Endymion. Father Captain de Soya travels to NGC 2629-4BIV after Heaven's Gate and before Barnard's World. Heaven's Gate is "a little more than eight" light years from Old Earth System, and Barnard's Star is six light years from Old Earth System. There is exactly one star greater than six but less than eight light years from Old Earth System that is not a brown dwarf - that star is Wolf 359.
