Lamp Mouth Leviathan
Lamp Mouth Leviathans, commonly known simply as Lamp Mouths, are massive aquatic creatures native to the ocean moon Mare Infinitus. They are kilometers in length, and have multiple mouths, masses of eyestalks, and numerous tendrils and barbels, some of which end in bioluminescent "lanterns" whose glow is visible even in daylight.
