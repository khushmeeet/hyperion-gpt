New Mecca
New Mecca is a planet that was part of the WorldWeb. It targeted as part of the second wave of allegedly Ousters assaults upon the Hegemony of Man.  Its population is largely High Muslim.  After The Fall, it went into "spasms of Martyrdom."
The Pax never fully controlled the planet due to its High Muslim population. It was one of the planets which entire population was rendered "lifeless" and sequestered elsewhere by elements of the TechnoCore.
