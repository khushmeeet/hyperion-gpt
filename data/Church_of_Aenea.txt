Church of Aenea
The Church of Aenea is a religious institution that arose in a remote Ouster society after having experienced the Aenean Shared Moment, several hundred years after its initial occurrence in human space. Despite the fact that Aenea had expressly insisted that there be no "Church of Aenea" and no veneration or adoration, these Ousters and Templars did so nonetheless.[1]
Since the Aenean Shared Moment, the Church of Aenea had grown in the alien tree ring to the point that at least a fourth of their population would become Aenean if given a chance.[1]
