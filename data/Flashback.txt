Flashback
Flashback is a drug that allows the user to flawlessly relive memories. It requires an array of neural implants in order to be used properly.
When Martin Silenus was four years old, his mother died from abuse of Flashback. He later briefly used the drug himself, although he quit after his second time after the drug recalled the memory of his mother's death.
