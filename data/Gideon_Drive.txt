Gideon Drive
The Gideon Drive is a starship drive technology that allows for instantaneous travel between two points in space. It functions similarly to farcaster technology, making use of The Void Which Binds. However, unlike farcasting, use of the Gideon Drive by a starship is invariably, violently fatal for human passengers, as the forces and acceleration generated by the device will pulverize organs and tissue. As such, only passenger vessels equipped with Pax  resurrection creches are equipped with Gideon Drive technology.
