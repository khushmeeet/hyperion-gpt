The Dying Earth
The Dying Earth is a series of books chronicling the nostalgic final days of Old Earth written by Martin Silenus. The books were published by Transline Publishing. The series is named after its first book, also titled The Dying Earth. 

The Dying Earth I
The first book in the series covered the idyllic final days of Old Earth. It was written in poetry, consisting of carefully selected sections of the author's larger epic Hyperion Cantos.[1]

The Dying Earth II
The second book in the series was published five standard months after the failure of the author's first attempt at publishing the Hyperion Cantos. Unlike book one, book two was written in plain prose and published as a short novel. It sold nineteen million copies.[2]
