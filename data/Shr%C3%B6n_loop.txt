Shrön loop
A Shrön loop (or Shrön Disk), is a storage device implant containing countless field-bubble memories, each capable of holding near infinte bits of information. Shrön loops are typically used for courier services as they cannot be accessed by the biological carrier. Shrön Loops are about the size of a thumbnail and very expensive [1].
Brawne Lamia carried a Shrön Loop that contained the downloaded first John Keats retrieval persona.
