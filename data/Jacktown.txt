Jacktown
Jacktown is the lower class area of the city of Keats, to some degree separated from the rest of the city. It consists largely of a "sprawling maze of slums and saloons", as opposed to the "Old City", which is primarily "polished stone and studied sterility".[1]

Locations in Jacktown
Abandoned Cathedral - located on the border between Jacktown and the Old City among tall warehouses that hide it from general view, in close proximity to the Hoolie River.[2]
