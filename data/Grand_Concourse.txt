Grand Concourse
This article is a stub. You can help Hyperion Cantos Wiki by  expanding it.
During the Web Era, the Grand Concourse was an expansive shopping, restaurant and bar mall that spanned a hundred kilometers like "an infinite main street". It was not physically located in any single world - instead, it consisted of many different segments on multiple worlds that were connected via military-sized, 200-meter high farcasters. It was similar in concept to the River Tethys or to Martin Silenus multi-world house.
